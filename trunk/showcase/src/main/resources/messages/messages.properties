home.title=Welcome to JFX Flow
home.message=JFX Flow is a free, open source framework for developing rich, \
  interactive and user friendly web-style GUIs for desktops using JavaFX (2.0+). \
  JFX Flow combines the powerful feature set of Java FX (styling, animations, FXML, \
  etc) with a simple ‘web flow’ style framework, that is easy to use and that fosters \
  clean architectural patterns, especially when developing JEE applications.

home.navigation=Navigation
home.navigation.description=Learn how JFX Flow helps you build applications \
  with support for browser-style navigation, such as back and forward buttons.

home.transitions=Page Transitions
home.transitions.description=See how JFX Flow builds upon JavaFX's powerful animation \
  toolkit to allow you to build cool animations to transition between pages.

home.threading=Threading
home.threading.description=JFX Flow provides a general toolkit to simplify working with \
  background threads in JavaFX. In particular it provides support for showing busy/wait \
  feedback, and provides a framework for error handling.

home.dialogs=Dialogs
home.dialogs.description=Dialogs should be used sparringly and should be limited to simple \
  alerts and prompts. Sometimes, however, they are unavoidable and JFX Flow provides a simple\
  framework for working with dialogs in JavaFX applications.

home.forms=Forms and Wizards (coming soon)
home.forms.description=JFX Flow will soon provide support for working with forms and wizards, \
  including form field validation and integration with the JFX Flow navigation mechanism.

navigation.title=Navigation with JFX Flow
navigation.message=At the heart of the JFX Flow system is its navigation framework. There are \
  three main navigation components of a typical JFX Flow application: the Browser, the \
  NavigationManager and Activities.

navigation.browser.callout=Browser
navigation.browser.info=Browser info

navigation.activity.callout=Activity
navigation.activity.info=Activity info

navigation.navigationManager.callout=Navigation Manager
navigation.navigationManager.info=Navigation info

# Transitions
#==============================================================================

transitions.title=Animated Page Transitions
transitions.message=Let's face it, animations are cooler than the Fonz, and we all want to make cool stuff.  \
  JFX Flow helps you do this by providing a small framework for creating animated page transitions. \
  Some default transitions, such as fade in and fade out, are provided for you, but you can write your \
  own custom page animations to do anything you like. Check out the links below to see some page \
  transitions in action.

transitions.fade=Fade In and Fade Out
transitions.fade.description=A gentle fade out of the current page, and then fade in of the next. This transition is \
  the default used by the Browser, but you can easily override this.

transitions.fly=Fly In and Fly Out
transitions.fly.description=The classic fly-in and fly-out transition.

transitions.custom=Custom transitions
transitions.custom.description=Build your own custom page transitions using JavaFX's animation framework.


#==============================================================================
# Transition Example
#==============================================================================

transitionExample.title=Everybody be Cool
transitionExample.message.fade=Never let your dreams fade away
transitionExample.message.fly=That's not flying, that's just falling with style.

# Threading
#==============================================================================

threading.title=Working with Threads
threading.message=Whether you are talking to a back-end server, reading from a file, or just \
  crunching some large numbers, you will need to use background threads. JFX Flow builds on top \
  of JavaFX's Worker framework to help make the user interaction side of this a little nicer. In \
  particular it provides a way to block the UI while a thread is running and helps you handle any \
  errors that may occur.

threading.blocking.title=Blocking the Screen
threading.blocking.message=JFX Flow provides a default way to block the entire screen while a \
  background thread is running. It does this using a 'glasspane', which stops the user from \
  interacting with your UI. You can style the glasspane however you like. The default style provided \
  by JFX Flow is subtle, simply changing the cursor to an hour-glass.
threading.block=Start
threading.block.normal=Click the start button to start a thread
threading.block.started=Working... the screen is now blocked
threading.block.done=Done, the screen is now released

threading.blocking.custom.message=JFX Flow doesn't force you to use this blocking mechanism if you don't \
  want. Often for special cases, you will need to provide your own feedback and control. You can still do \
  this using JavaFX's built in Worker framework. The button below shows a custom task that uses a \
  ProgressIndicator to show the thread progress.
threading.block.custom=Start
threading.block.custom.normal=Click the start button to start a thread
threading.block.custom.started=Working... the screen is not blocked
threading.block.custom.done=Done

threading.errors.title=Handling Errors
threading.errors.message=With background tasks you usually have a lot more things that can go wrong. JFX \
  Flow provides a mechanism for catching and handling exceptions in your workers. The default handler \
  simply takes the user to an error page with details on the exception. This is intended only for unexpected \
  an unhandled execptions however, and in most cases you will want to provide your own custom error page. With \
  JFX Flow this is easy to do. To see the default error page in action, click the button below.
threading.errors.start=Make an error
